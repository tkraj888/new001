          CarTechIndia is committed to protecting your privacy. We aim to provide trustworthy, industry-leading products and services so that you can focus on building meaningful connections. Our approach to privacy is to provide you with clear information about our data practices. That’s why we have tried to keep legal and technical jargon to a minimum.

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
          This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, what types of cookies are placed on your device when you visit our website and how we use them.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
          This Cookie Policy does not address how we deal with your personal information generally.
        </p>

        <p class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">What are cookies?</p>
        <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
          Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device’s memory. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.
        </p>

        <p class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">Are there different types of cookies?</p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-xl"><b>First-party and third-party cookies</b></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
          There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser’s language preferences and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. For example, we use third-party cookies to measure user numbers on our website or to enable you to share content with others across social media platforms.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-xl"><b>Session and persistent cookies</b></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
          There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and are not automatically deleted when you close your browser. These types of cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign-in to our website again and for analytical purposes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg">
          Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes. Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our service or opened an email that we have sent them. Tracking URLs are custom-generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our web pages comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.
        </p>

        <p class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">How can you control cookies?</p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg">
          There are several cookie management options available to you. Please note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may make browsing our website a less satisfying experience. In some cases, you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our site.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-xl"><b>Browser and devices controls</b></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
          Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for each internet browser. You can check the specific steps in your particular browser help menu.
